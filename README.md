## Bracket Sequence Question

**Given sequence:**  
`[((())()(())]]`

**Is the sequence correct?**  
❌ No.

**Reason:**  
The bracket sequence [((())()(())]] is not correct because the brackets are not balanced. The first round bracket ( is never closed.
To fix it, the second-to-last square bracket ] should be replaced with a round bracket ). The correct sequence is:

**Corrected sequence:**  
[((())()(()))]
